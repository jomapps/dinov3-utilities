## Starting Setup

Your infrastructure selections are compatible and will work well together. Here's the verified starting setup:

- **GPU Server**: Hyperstack.cloud Nvidia A6000 GPU, 16 cores, 64GB RAM, Ubuntu 24.04
- **Primary Database**: MongoDB installed locally on the same server
- **Graph Database**: ArangoDB accessed via PathRAG API endpoints
- **Object Storage**: Cloudflare R2 with S3-compatible API
- **Caching & Message Queue**: Redis installed locally (handles both caching and pub/sub)
- **Model Storage**: Hugging Face Hub for DINOv3 model weights and versioning
- **Secrets Management**: .env files for configuration and API keys

**Notes on Compatibility**:
- ✅ A6000 GPU (48GB VRAM) is excellent for DINOv3 - much better than recommended specs
- ✅ Local MongoDB + Redis reduces latency and simplifies deployment
- ✅ PathRAG integration provides ArangoDB without additional setup
- ✅ Single-server approach reduces complexity for initial deployment
- ✅ All services can scale horizontally when needed in the future
